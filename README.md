The Random Music Bot is a Telegram bot that allows users to search for random albums and tracks from the last.fm database using tags. 

The bot also provides links to YouTube video (which is the first result of a search by an artist's name and title of a track/album) and the last.fm page.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies with requirements.txt:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Enter your info in the config.py file (you will need to obtain last.fm and YouTube API tokens, sign up for a last.fm account, and create a Telegram bot).
